Overview of All About Perfume

I created a website for a small business in South Africa that sells affordable, luxury-inspired perfumes. The site is simple and easy to use, with five main pages: Home, About, Products, Enquiry, and Contact. Each page includes useful information like vision, mission, target audience, product details, contact info, and a form for questions.

In Part 1, I wrote the proposal, built the structure using HTML and organized everything on GitHub. In Part 2,I fixed all my mistakes from Part 1,drew wiresframes, added comments to my code, completely changed the typography and colour scheme, and styled myS website with CSS to make it responsive on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

In Part 3, I focused on improving the functionality and user experience of my website. I updated and cleaned up my JavaScript so the forms on the Enquiry and Contact pages validate properly and give clear feedback to the user. I also made sure the search feature works and takes the user to the right pages. I improved the layout and design based on feedback, making the site easier to navigate and more professional.
